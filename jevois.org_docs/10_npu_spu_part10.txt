TITRE: JeVois: Converting and running neural networks for JeVois-Pro NPU
================================================================================

JeVois-Pro
includes a 5-TOPS neural processing unit (NPU) that is integrated into the Amlogic A311D processor. This neural accelerator has the fastest connection to the main memory (direct DMA access) and hence data transfers and network execution can be very fast. Also, it does not suffer from having limited on-chip memory like some of the other accelerators do, thus quite large networks can run on the NPU.
Note
JeVois-Pro
only. This accelerator is not supported on
JeVois-A33
Supported neural network frameworks
Caffe
TensorFlow
TensorFlow-Lite
ONNX (and pyTorch via conversion to ONNX)
Darknet
Keras
The NPU can run models quantized to uint8, int8, or int16 weights. It does not support float weights and hence quantization and conversion are necessary. A limited number of operations and layer types is supported by the hardware, which further constrains what can run on it. But it is manyfold faster than a standard CPU.
For execution on NPU, your model will be quantized and then converted on a Linux desktop to a proprietary blob format that can then be transferred to JeVois-Pro microSD for execution.
Procedure
Read and understand the JeVois docs about
Running neural networks on JeVois-A33 and JeVois-Pro
Make sure you understand the quantization concepts in
Converting and Quantizing Deep Neural Networks for JeVois-Pro
Check out the
NPU SDK docs
. Of particular interest is the
Model Transcoding and Running User Guide
The NPU only supports a specific set of layer types. If you try to convert a network that contains unsupported layers, the conversion may sometimes seem to succeed but your converted network may fail to run. Check the
Layer and Operation Support Guide
before you attempt to convert a network.
You need to download and install the Amlogic NPU SDK to convert/quantize your model on a desktop computer running Linux Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
Everything you need at runtime (NPU runtime libraries) is pre-installed on your JeVois-Pro microSD.
Obtain a model: train your own, or download a pretrained model.
Obtain some parameters about the model (e.g., pre-processing mean, stdev, scale, expected input image size, RGB or BGR, packed (NWHC) or planar (NCHW) pixels, etc).
Obtain a sample dataset that will be used for quantization, to determine the range of values experienced on each layer of the network during inference, and to set the quantization parameters accordingly. The dataset should be representative, i.e., it should contain the objects you want to detect, along with other things you want to ignore.
Convert and quantize the model using the NPU SDK.
Copy the converted model to JeVois-Pro microSD card under JEVOIS[PRO]:/share/dnn/custom/
Create a JeVois model zoo entry for your model, where you specify the model parameters and the location where you copied your model files. Typically this is a YAML file under JEVOIS[PRO]:/share/dnn/custom/
Launch the JeVois
DNN
module. It will scan the custom directory for any valid YAML file, and make your model available as one available value for the
pipe
parameter of the DNN module's Pipeline component. Select that pipe to run your model.
Setting up the NPU SDK
Note
Everything below is to be run on a fast x86_64 desktop computer running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux or later, not on your JeVois-Pro camera. At the end, we will copy the converted model to microSD and then run inference on JeVois-Pro with that model.
The Amlogic/VeriSilicon NPU SDK is distributed by Khadas, which manufactures a development board that uses the same Amlogic A311D processor as
JeVois-Pro
git lfs install
git lfs clone --recursive https://github.com/khadas/aml_npu_sdk.git
cd aml_npu_sdk/acuity-toolkit/
No need to install Ubuntu packages or Python wheels, everything is included in that git repo.
Getting a sample dataset for quantization
To quantize a model, we need to know the expected range of values experienced at each layer of the network. For that, we need a representative sample dataset, which typically would be about 1000 images from your training or validation set. This is very important as it will set the quantization parameters. The images should contain some of the targets you want to detect, and also more things that your camera may see (whether or not you do not want to detect those).
The dataset is just a folder containing some images, plus a text file that contains a list of the image paths, one per line.
The sample models we convert below were trained on the
COCO dataset
. Let's download the
2017 validation set
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
unzip val2017.zip
If you have retrained the model on a custom dataset, use that dataset instead.
val2017 has 5,000 images which is more than we need. The unix command
shuf
can randomly shuffle a list of names and take the first
, so let's use it to grab 1000 random images from the dataset. We save a list of those file paths to
dataset.txt
that will be used for quantization:
ls /path/to/val2017/*.jpg | shuf -n 1000 > dataset.txt
dataset.txt
should now contain 1000 lines (your results will vary since shuf is random):
/path/to/val2017/000000382030.jpg
/path/to/val2017/000000436617.jpg
/path/to/val2017/000000138550.jpg
/path/to/val2017/000000226154.jpg
/path/to/val2017/000000319369.jpg
...
you will use this dataset during model conversion.
APPROACH 1 (simplest): For YOLOv8 / YOLOv9 / YOLOv10 / YOLO11 models
For best accuracy, we want the quantized network to output separate tensors for class probabilities, bounding box coordinates, segmentation masks, etc. This is because these tensors have very different ranges of values; hence, it is better to quantize each one separately, instead of combining them into one big tensor for post-processing (see
Converting and Quantizing Deep Neural Networks for JeVois-Pro
for more details).
We provide a script
jevoispro-npu-convert.sh
to make converting YOLOv8 and later models. It supports all variants: detection, instance segmentation, pose/skeleton, oriented bounding boxes (OBB), and classification. Use it as follows:
1. Get the model and export to ONNX
Here, we just get a standard yolov8n model for example, which we resize to 1024x576 resolution (same aspect ratio as our camera's native video frames). If you have a retrained model, provide its name below instead of yolov8n.pt:
Everything we run here should be from inside
aml_npu_sdk/acuity-toolkit/python/
cd aml_npu_sdk/acuity-toolkit/python/
pip install ultralytics
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=onnx imgsz=576,1024 opset=12 optimize simplify
mv yolov8n.onnx yolov8n-1024x576-custom.onnx
If you want to retrain the model on a custom dataset first, see our tutorial:
http://jevois.org/tutorials/UserYolo.html
2. Convert for NPU using our script
The script just determines the correct output tensors to use for various YOLO variants and various tasks, for compatibility with the JeVois post-processors. It works as follows:
USAGE: jevoispro-npu-convert.sh <base><version><size>[-task]-<suffix>.onnx [dataset.txt] [iterations]
Where:
- base: yolo (will add more later)
- version: v8, v9, v10, 11
- size: n (nano, fastest but less accurate), t (tiny), s (small), m (medium), etc
- task: none or -det for detection
-seg (detection + semantic intance segmentation)
-pose (detection + pose/skeleton estimation)
-obb (detection with oriented bounding boxes)
-cls (classification)
- suffix: something that makes your model name different than the existing ones, e.g.,
yolov8n-1024x576-test.onnx, yolo11s-pose-custom.onnx
- dataset.txt: a text file containing a list of images to use for quantization. These should be part of the validation
set used to train the model. Typically 1000 images or so. If no dataset file is given, will try to use
dataset-<task>.txt in the current directory.
- iterations: number of images from dataset.txt to use for quantization, or use all if not given.
Note
It is not completely clear from the NPU SDK docs how adding more iterations may improve model accuracy. On your first try converting a model, you may just want to use 1 iteration, which will be fast. Then if the model runs correctly on
JeVois-Pro
, you can convert it again with more iterations and see whether the accuracy improves.
So we just run the script as follows:
jevoispro-npu-convert.sh yolov8n-1024x576-custom.onnx dataset.txt 1
We obtain 3 results in outputs/yolov8n-1024x576-custom/
libnn_yolov8n-1024x576-custom.so
# runtime library for JeVois-Pro that will load the model
yolov8n-1024x576-custom.nb
# model weights
yolov8n-1024x576-custom.yml
# JeVois model zoo file
Copy all 3 files to your microSD into
JEVOISPRO:/share/dnn/custom/
Start your
JeVois-Pro
camera
Select the
DNN
machine vision module
Set the
pipe
parameter to
NPU:Detect:yolov8n-1024x576-custom
APPROACH 2 (easy): Using the Khadas conversion script
The NPU SDK contains a (closed-source) conversion script that can be used not only for YOLO variants, but for any supported model. See docs on
the Khadas web site
Using the same yolov8n-1024x576-custom.onnx as in approach 1, we can convert the model as follows:
cd aml_npu_sdk/acuity-toolkit/python/
./convert --model-name yolov8n-1024x576-custom \
--platform onnx \
--model yolov8n-1024x576-custom.onnx \
--mean-values
'0 0 0 0.00392156'
--quantized-dtype asymmetric_affine \
--source-files dataset.txt \
--batch-size 1 \
--iterations 1 \
--kboard VIM3 --
print
-level 1
We obtain 2 results in outputs/yolov8n-1024x576-custom/
libnn_yolov8n-1024x576-custom.so
# runtime library for JeVois-Pro that will load the model
yolov8n-1024x576-custom.nb
# model weights
For
JeVois-Pro
to run this model, we need to create a YAML zoo file
yolov8n-1024x576-custom.yml
as follows:
%YAML 1.0
---
yolov8n-1024x576-custom:
preproc: Blob
mean: "0 0 0"
scale: 0.003921568393707275
nettype: NPU
model: "dnn/custom/yolov8n-1024x576-custom.nb"
library: "dnn/custom/libnn_yolov8n-1024x576-custom.so"
comment: "Converted using JeVois NPU SDK and Asymmetric Affine quant"
postproc: Detect
detecttype: YOLOv8
# Create a text file with your own class names:
classes: "dnn/labels/coco-labels.txt"
Copy all 3 files to your microSD into
JEVOISPRO:/share/dnn/custom/
Start your
JeVois-Pro
camera
Select the
DNN
machine vision module
Set the
pipe
parameter to
NPU:Detect:yolov8n-1024x576-custom
You may want to try the conversion again with more iterations and see whether the resulting model is more accurate.
APPROACH 3 (most step-by-step): Using the NPU SDK conversion scripts
The NPU SDK provides 3 scripts in
aml_npu_sdk/acuity-toolkit/demo/
that will need to be edited and then run in sequence on your desktop:
0_import_model.sh
: Converts from the source framework (Caffe, TensorFlow, etc) to an intermediate representation, and then computes some stats about the ranges of values encountered on each layer on a sample dataset. These ranges of values will be used to set quantization parameters.
1_quantize_model.sh
: Quantize the model using asymmetric affine uint8, or dynamic fixed point int8 or int16. This yields the model that we will run on
JeVois-Pro
, in a
.nb
proprietary binary blob format.
2_export_case_code.sh
: Creates some C code that can be compiled on a target platform (like JeVois-Pro) to create a standalone app that will load and run the model on one image. We will not use that code since the JeVois software provides its own code that directly links the model to the camera sensor and to the GUI. However, we will inspect it so we can get input and output specifications for our YAML zoo file.
Check out some more docs about this
here
We choose YOLOv7-tiny for this tutorial because:
It is available in Darknet format, using only operations and layers supported by the NPU.
JeVois already provides a post-processor for it.
It cnnot be handled by the simpler approaches shown above.
1. Get the model
Go to
https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
Let's download YOLOv7-tiny which runs on 416x416 inputs. Either click on the latest Release and then on
yolov7-tiny.weights
in the list of assets at the bottom, or run this:
wget https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/yolov4/yolov7-tiny.weights
We also need a description of the network's structure, which we find in the
cfg
folder of the repo:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov7-tiny.cfg
2. Get a sample dataset
Do as above in Approach 1.
3. Edit and run 0_import_model.sh
The file contains various commented out examples for various frameworks. Here we need to:
change the NAME
enable the Darknet blurb, comment out the other frameworks. Note: pegasus is run twice, first for import, and then to generate metadata about the input. We only replace the first one by the framework we want to import from.
(not needed for Darknet, maybe needed for others) set the input-size-list to our input size, which here is 1x3x416x416 accouding to
yolov7-tiny.cfg
we need to know input pre-processing scale, mean, stdev. Tiny YOLO v7 just expects RGB images with pixel values in [0.0 .. 1.0]. Hence we will use mean=[0 0 0], stdev=[1 1 1], scale=1/255=0.0039215686, rgb=true.
Below,
channel-mean-value
expects 4 values: 3 means for 3 color channels, and 1 scale.
We end up with this modified
0_import_model.sh

--source-file dataset.txt
Note
Do not cut and paste the '# JEVOIS edited' comments above, they will break the code, remove them.
Run it, it should complete with no errors:
./0_import_model.sh
You can check out yolov7-tiny_inputmeta.yml for a description of the input parameters, and yolov7-tiny.json for a description of the model graph.
If this steps yields errors, maybe some operations are not supported, which may happen towards the end of the network. In such case, examine the network in Netron and look at which layer failed to convert, then add a parameter for
–outputs /some/layer
to truncate the network to that layer.
4. Edit and run 1_quantize_model.sh
Because our input range is [0.0 .. 1.0], this calls for uint8 asymmetric affine quantization so that our pre-processing followed by quantization will reduce to a no-op (see
Converting and Quantizing Deep Neural Networks for JeVois-Pro
).
So we enable that and also change the model NAME, end up with this modified
1_quantize_model.sh
#!/bin/bash
NAME=yolov7-tiny
# JEVOIS edited
ACUITY_PATH=../bin/
pegasus=${ACUITY_PATH}pegasus

# JEVOIS edited

with
-input-meta  ${NAME}_inputmeta.yml \
--model  ${NAME}.json \
--model-data  ${NAME}.data
Run it, it should complete with no errors:
./1_quantize_model.sh
You can check out yolov7-tiny.quantize to see the min/max value range for each layer on the sample dataset, and how every layer was accordingly quantized. This file will be deleted when the next script runs.
5. Edit and run 2_export_case_code.sh
Here, we just need to set the model NAME, and also select the correct NPU model, which for the A311D processor in
JeVois-Pro
is
VIPNANOQI_PID0X88
. We end up with:
#!/bin/bash

All right, everything we need is in yolov7-tiny_nbg_unify/
Converted model: yolov7-tiny.nb
C code: vnn_yolov7tiny.c which we will inspect to derive our input and output tensor specifications.
6. Create YAML zoo file
We start with the
YoloV4
entry from zoo file
/jevoispro/share/dnn/npu.yml
already in the JeVois microSD (and available in the Config tab of the GUI).
To get the specs of the quantized input and outputs, we inspect yolov7-tiny_nbg_unify/vnn_yolov7tiny.c and look for tensor definitions. We find this (comments added to explain the next step):
/*-----------------------------------------
Tensor initialize
-----------------------------------------*/
attr.dtype.fmt = VSI_NN_DIM_FMT_NCHW;
/* @input_0:out0 */
attr.size[0] = 416;
// JEVOIS: last dimension (fastest varying; here, W)
attr.size[1] = 416;
// JEVOIS: next dimension (here, H)
attr.size[2] = 3;
// JEVOIS: next dimension (here, C)
attr.size[3] = 1;
// JEVOIS: first dimension (here, N)
attr.dim_num = 4;
// JEVOIS: input should be a 4D tensor
attr.dtype.scale = 0.003921568393707275;
// JEVOIS: scale for AA quantization
attr.dtype.zero_point = 0;
// JEVOIS: zero point for AA quantization
attr.dtype.qnt_type = VSI_NN_QNT_TYPE_AFFINE_ASYMMETRIC;
// JEVOIS: that is AA quantization
NEW_NORM_TENSOR
(norm_tensor[0], attr, VSI_NN_TYPE_UINT8);
// JEVOIS: that is 8U type
/* @output_90_198:out0 */
attr.size[0] = 52;
attr.size[1] = 52;
attr.size[2] = 255;
attr.size[3] = 1;
attr.dim_num = 4;
attr.dtype.scale = 0.0038335032295435667;
attr.dtype.zero_point = 0;
attr.dtype.qnt_type = VSI_NN_QNT_TYPE_AFFINE_ASYMMETRIC;
NEW_NORM_TENSOR
(norm_tensor[1], attr, VSI_NN_TYPE_UINT8);
/* @output_94_205:out0 */
attr.size[0] = 26;
attr.size[1] = 26;
attr.size[2] = 255;
attr.size[3] = 1;
attr.dim_num = 4;
attr.dtype.scale = 0.0038371747359633446;
attr.dtype.zero_point = 0;
attr.dtype.qnt_type = VSI_NN_QNT_TYPE_AFFINE_ASYMMETRIC;
NEW_NORM_TENSOR
(norm_tensor[2], attr, VSI_NN_TYPE_UINT8);
/* @output_98_212:out0 */
attr.size[0] = 13;
attr.size[1] = 13;
attr.size[2] = 255;
attr.size[3] = 1;
attr.dim_num = 4;
attr.dtype.scale = 0.003918845672160387;
attr.dtype.zero_point = 0;
attr.dtype.qnt_type = VSI_NN_QNT_TYPE_AFFINE_ASYMMETRIC;
NEW_NORM_TENSOR
(norm_tensor[3], attr, VSI_NN_TYPE_UINT8);
NEW_NORM_TENSOR
#define NEW_NORM_TENSOR(_id, _attr, _dtype)
Definition
NetworkNPU.C:62
So we have one input and three outputs (for 3 YOLO scales), and we derive their JeVois specs from the above generated code as follows (see
Converting and Quantizing Deep Neural Networks for JeVois-Pro
for syntax of JeVois tensor specs):
intensors:
"NCHW:8U:1x3x416x416:AA:0.003921568393707275:0"
outtensors:
"8U:1x255x52x52:AA:0.0038335032295435667:0, 8U:1x255x26x26:AA:0.0038371747359633446:0, 8U:1x255x13x13:AA:0.003918845672160387:0"
For YOLO post-processing (until VOLOv7), we need definitions of anchors. We just get those from yolov7-tiny.cfg:
anchors = 10,13, 16,30, 33,23, 30,61, 62,45, 59,119, 116,90, 156,198, 373,326
In the YAML file below, we will split this list by YOLO scales (here, the 9 w,h pairs correspond to 3 pairs each for 3 scales. We separate scales by semicolon below).
Because YOLOv7 uses the "new style" of YOLO coordinates, we need to disable Post-Processor sigmoid and set Post-Processor scalexy to 2.0. You would want that for YOLOv5/v7, and set sigmoid to true and scalexy to 0.0 to use old-style box coordinates for YOLOv2/v3/v4. You can look at the differences in jevois::dnn::PostProcessorDetectYOLO::yolo_one()
We just modify the name and file locations, bring all the global definitions into our file (like preproc, nettype, etc which were set globally in npu.yml and hence not repeated for the YoloV4 entry we are copying from), and end up with the following
yolov7-tiny.yml
(pre-processor mean and scale are as we used them in 0_import_model.sh):
%YAML 1.0
---
yolov7-tiny:
preproc: Blob
mean:
"0 0 0"
scale: 0.0039215686
nettype: NPU
model:
"dnn/custom/yolov7-tiny.nb"
intensors:
"NCHW:8U:1x3x416x416:AA:0.003921568393707275:0"
outtensors:
"8U:1x255x52x52:AA:0.0038335032295435667:0, 8U:1x255x26x26:AA:0.0038371747359633446:0, 8U:1x255x13x13:AA:0.003918845672160387:0"
postproc: Detect
detecttype: RAWYOLO
classes:
"npu/detection/coco-labels.txt"
anchors:
"10,13, 16,30, 33,23;   30,61, 62,45, 59,119;   116,90, 156,198, 373,326"
sigmoid: false
scalexy: 2.0
We copy yolov7-tiny.yml and yolov7-tiny.nb to /jevoispro/share/dnn/custom/ on JeVois-Pro and let's try it!
7. Test the model and adjust any parameters
Select the
DNN
machine vision module
Set the
pipe
parameter to
NPU:Detect:yolov7-tiny
It works! Quite fast too, around 55 fps for the network inference only (the part that runs on NPU).
Note
You can repeat this tutorial using int8-DFP quantization instead in
1_quantize_model.sh
. You then only need to change the intensors and outtensors specs in your YAML to the obtained DFP parameters. We did it, and the network is running fine, but about half the speed (about 22.5 fps). So AA quantization is the way to go with this network.
Tips
If you get a "Graph verification failed" when you try to run your network, maybe you entered the tensor specifications incorrectly. Under the Config tab of the GUI you can edit your yolov7-tiny.yml and fix it.
Khadas has their own docs which you may want to check out since their VIM3 board uses the same Amlogic A311D processor as JeVois-Pro. But note that on JeVois we skip using the generated C code as JeVois-Pro already provides all the code we need to run NPU models.

When converting from pyTorch, if you get some strange error like
RuntimeError: [enforce fail at inline_container.cc:208] . file not found: archive/constants.pkl
maybe your model was saved with a version of pyTorch more recent than the one included in the NPU SDK. You may need to save your model to ONNX instead, and then try to convert again from ONNX. Or it might be that the model uses layer types or operations that the NPU does not support, in which case converting to ONNX will not help. You would need to change your network to only include layers and operations that can be mapped to NPU.
Note
Thus far, we have not been able to successfully convert directly from pyTorch using the NPU SDK, we always get some kind of error. But first exporting the source model to ONNX and then running the NPU SDK on that works fine, as long as only NPU-supported operations are used in the source model.
For examples of how we sometimes skip unsupported last layers (e.g., which do reshaping, detection box decoding, non-maximum suppresion over boxes, etc), see
Converting and running neural networks for Myriad-X VPU
and
Converting and running neural networks for Hailo-8 SPU
Also see
Tips for running custom neural networks
Another example: Object Detection using YOLOv10n
The procedure for YOLOv10n was almost the same. We had to fine-tune a few things:
Get the code at
https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10/tree/main
Go through their installation steps, including creating a conda environment and getting all dependencies.
You can also retrain on a custom dataset at this stage.
To export to ONNX, using opset 13 gave some conversion errors, so we used opset 12. We can also set a custom image resolution in that step using
imgsz
parameter:
yolo export model=jameslahm/yolov10n format=onnx opset=12 simplify imgsz=288,512
Some layers towards the end of the network were giving size errors, maybe because of the different opset. In any case, we wanted the raw YOLO output. Thus, we inspected the network in Netron and decided to use
/model.23/Transpose_output_0
as output layer in
0_import_model.sh
# ...
#Onnx
$pegasus
import
onnx\
--model  ${NAME}.onnx \
--output-model ${NAME}.json \
--outputs /model.23/Transpose_output_0 \
--output-data ${NAME}.data
# ...
It converted fine. However, it was not generating any boxes on the display. Upon inspection of the output tensor, confidence values for all classes were always zero. Looking at the yolov10n-512x288.quantize generated during conversion showed a range of [-108.24 .. 611.29] for the values in the output tensor. Indeed, in that output tensor, which is 1x3024x84 for inputs 1x3x288x512, both 4 box coordinates (which can vary within 512x288, and more in case boxes partially go outside the input image), and 80 class confidences (in [0..1]), were concatenated. That means that with 8 bits of quantization, any class confidence in [0..1] would always map to the same number (the zero-point of quantization):
0 quantized maps to -108.24 dequantized
1 quantized maps to -105.43 dequantized (quantization step is (611.29+108.24)/256 = 2.81)
...
255 quantized maps to 611.29 dequantized
So with a quantization step of 2.81, we cannot discriminate values in the [0..1] range.
So we changed the quantization to dynamic_fixed_point and int16. The results used 5 bits for the decimal portion, which should be enough to represent class accuracies reasonably well. Another approach, which we use for YOLOv8 and later, is to output separate tensors for class probabilities and bounding boxes. This is what we did in Approach 1 and Approach 2.
This worked well, and YOLOv10n for NPU now included in the JeVois distribution and microSD image.
However, a 16-bit quantized model is slower than 8-bit quantized. This is why we now prefer to output raw tensors before concatenation, as we have done above in Approach 1 above.

pyTorch (via export to ONNX)
Procedure
Read and understand the JeVois docs about
Running neural networks on JeVois-A33 and JeVois-Pro
Make sure you understand the quantization concepts in
Converting and Quantizing Deep Neural Networks for JeVois-Pro
You need to download and install the Hailo Software Suite docker to convert/compress your model on a desktop computer running Linux Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
Registration and password required. Hailo reserves the right to accept or deny your developer registration request.
Everything you need for runtime inference (HailoRT runtime libraries, Hailo PCIe kernel driver) is pre-installed on your JeVois microSD.
Obtain a model: train your own, or download a pretrained model.
Obtain some parameters about the model (e.g., pre-processing mean, stdev, scale, expected input image size, RGB or BGR, packed (NWHC) or planar (NCHW) pixels, etc).
Either convert the model using the Hailo command-line tools, or using the Hailo model zoo:
Approach one: command line tools:
Use
hailo parser
to convert the source model to a Hailo archive (.har)
Use
hailo optimize
to optimize the model for Hailo-8 and quantize to int8.
Use
hailo compiler
to convert the model to a binary blob (.hef) that can run on JeVois-Pro
Additional commands are available to visualize your model, check its performance on a validation set, etc.
Try
hailo tutorial
for a jupyter tutorial from Hailo.
Approach 2: if your model, or a highly similar one (e.g., yolo11 vs. yolo8), is already in the Hailo Model Zoo, you can get a possibly better-optimized conversion by using the
hailomz compile
command instead.
We provide examples of both approaches below.
Copy converted model to JeVois microSD card under JEVOISPRO:/share/dnn/custom/
Create a JeVois model zoo entry for your model, where you specify the model parameters and the location where you copied your model files. Typically this is a YAML file under JEVOISPRO:/share/dnn/custom/
Launch the JeVois
DNN
module. It will scan the custom directory for any valid YAML file, and make your model available as one available value for the
pipe
parameter of the DNN module's Pipeline component. Select that pipe to run your model.
Setting up the Hailo Software Suite
Note
Everything below is to be run on a fast x86_64 desktop computer running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux or later, not on your JeVois-Pro camera. At the end, we will copy the converted model to microSD and then run inference on JeVois-Pro with that model.
We use HailoRT-4.19.0 below but later versions should work as well. For best compatibility, please download the same version as is installed on your camera (type
!dpkg --list | grep hailo
in the console of the camera).
Check out the
official docs
The
Hailo model zoo
has many models that can run on Hailo-8. Also check it out on
GitHub
for additional files and model retraining code.
Request a developer account at hailo.ai, login, and go to
https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/sw-downloads/
Download the
Hailo Software Suite - Docker
Download the
HailoRT – Ubuntu package (deb) for amd64
Download the
HailoRT – PCIe driver Ubuntu package (deb)
Install the PCIe drivers and runtime library. This is not strictly necessary but it will eliminate many warnings as we proceed (say Y to DKMS, it will carry the driver through kernel updates; do not worry if it fails, maybe you need to install dkms, kernel-headers, etc):
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/hailort-pcie-driver_4.19.0_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/hailort_4.19.0_amd64.deb
Install docker if you do not yet have it:
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# give your user docker access; need to reboot to take effect
Install the nvidia-container-toolkit if you have an nvidia GPU, so that you can use the GPU in docker to optimize your model much faster, following the
latest instructions
. At the time of this writing, these were:
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
&& curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
sed
's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g'
| \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
Unzip the Hailo Software Suite you downloaded:
mkdir hailodev
cd hailodev
unzip ~/Downloads/hailo_ai_sw_suite_2024-10_docker.zip
./hailo_ai_sw_suite_docker_run.sh
After the docker image and container are setup, you should see this:
Welcome to Hailo Software Suite Container
To list available commands, please type:
----------------------------------------------------
HailoRT:                hailortcli -h
Dataflow Compiler:      hailo -h
Hailo Model Zoo:        hailomz -h
TAPPAS:                 hailo_run_app -h
----------------------------------------------------
(hailo_virtualenv) hailo@mypc:/local/workspace$
At this point, you can get a model from the Hailo Model Zoo and retrain it, get your own model and convert it, etc. following the Hailo docs. We show an example below.
When you are done, just
exit
the docker container.
To resume later, type
./hailo_ai_sw_suite_docker_run.sh --resume
To restart fresh and replace the old container by a new one, type
./hailo_ai_sw_suite_docker_run.sh --override
To copy files between your host and the Hailo docker, try this on your host (not in the container):
from inside the container,
/local/shared_with_docker/
is shared with
shared_with_docker/
in the host directory that also has
hailo_ai_sw_suite_docker_run.sh
so this is the easiest way to transfer files to/from the container. Otherwise:
sudo docker container ls -a
shows the ID of the container, e.g.,
4f6342fbc915
sudo docker cp myfile 4f6342fbc915:/local/workspace/
copies from host to container
sudo docker cp 4f6342fbc915:/local/workspace/myfile .
copies from container to host
see

for more (need to be logged into your Hailo account).
Approach 1: Model conversion using Hailo command-line tools
Let's convert a YOLOv7 object detection network as an example.
Everything we run below is from inside the docker container we started above.
1.1. Get the model
Go to
https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7
and check it out
We are going to use the base YOLOv7, full version, to see how fast this Hailo board is with a large model:
wget https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/download/v0.1/yolov7.pt
1.2. Since our model is pyTorch, convert it to ONNX first
The model is in pyTorch, but the YOLOv7 team provides an
export.py
that can export it to onnx, as is often the case with recent models:
git clone https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.git
cd yolov7
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 export.py --weights ../yolov7.pt --simplify --img-size 640 --batch-size 1
cd ..
Note
Installing the requirements uninstalls the hailo-provided torch, then installs apparently the same version. This may interfere with other aspects of the Hailo software suite. So you may want to do that in a different virtualenv or on your native host and then copy the result to the container as shown above.
We now have
yolov7.onnx
To visualize it using Netron, run
google-chrome
https://netron.app
(still within the container), select "Open
Model...", and then select the model, which is in
/local/workspace/yolov7.onnx
in the container. In particular, we see 3 outputs, 1x3x80x80x85, 1x3x40x40x85, 1x3x20x20x85 for the usual 3 YOLO scales (shapes are unusual, we will fix that later). Note that the original model includes some additional post-processing, but that was stripped from the export, which is great because it may not be supported by the hardware accelerator. The JeVois software will provide post-processing. Input is 1x3x640x640 (NCHW).
1.3. Run the Hailo parser
The Hailo Model Zoo User Guide in the
Hailo download section
has good detailed instructions.
We also check out the
Hailo Dataflow Compiler docs
First, parse the model from ONNX into a Hailo archive (HAR):
hailo parser onnx yolov7.onnx
We get some errors about unsupported layers 298, 299, 301, 302, 304, 305 and a recommendation to try again, "using
these end node names: Conv_297, Conv_300, Conv_303". Those are outputs before final reshaping, e.g., conv_303 (last Conv block towards bottom of the graph in Netron) is 1x255x20x20 then gets reshaped to 1x3x20x20x85. Indeed, we should use Conv_303 as this is the kind of YOLO output shape that
jevois::dnn::PostProcessorDetect
can handle. So we try again (after running
hailo parser onnx yolov7.onnx –help
to get some help):
hailo parser onnx yolov7.onnx --end-node-names Conv_297 Conv_300 Conv_303
Note
If you get an error
onnx.onnx_cpp2py_export.checker.ValidationError: Your model ir_version 10 is higher than the checker's (9).
that means that you need to use an older version of ONNX during the export in step 1. We recommend installing
pip install ultralytics
in the hailo container to avoid this problem, then copy the model's .pt file to the container and run the export to ONNX in the hailo container.
Success, we now have
yolov7.har
1.4. Get a sample dataset
We need a sample dataset for quantization of the model. It will be processed through the model (forward inference only) to determine the range of values encountered on every layer. These ranges will then be used for quantization.
If you trained your model on a custom dataset, copy about 100 images from your validation set into a new directory here.
Our model was trained on the
COCO dataset
. Let's download the
2017 validation set
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
unzip val2017.zip
That's 5,000 images which is more than we need. The unix command
shuf
can randomly shuffle a list of names and take the first
, so let's use it to grab 100 random images from the dataset and copy them to a new directory
sampledata
mkdir sampledata
cp `ls ./val2017/*.jpg | shuf -n 100` sampledata/
sampledata/
should now contain 100 jpeg images.
Hailo wants the sample dataset as a
".npy file containing numpy array of preprocessed images with shape
(calib_size, h, w, c)"
(from running
hailo optimize –help
). So we need to write a little python script
numpy_sampledata.py
to do that:
import
numpy
as
np
import
os
from
PIL
import
Image
dir =
'sampledata'
width = 640
height = 640
numimages = 100
dataset = np.ndarray((numimages, height, width, 3), np.float32)
idx = 0
for
path
in
os.listdir(dir):
fname = os.path.join(dir, path)
if
os.path.isfile(fname):
image = Image.open(fname).resize((width, height));
arr = np.array(image).astype(np.float32)
arr = (arr - 0.0) / 255.0
# pre-processing. Here: mean=[0 0 0], scale=1/255 but varies by model
dataset[idx, :] = arr
idx += 1
with
open(
'sampledata.npy'
'wb'
as
f:
np.save(f, dataset)
We run the script and get
sampledata.npy
1.5. Optimize the model
Launch the Hailo optimizer on our model and using our sample dataset. This will quantize the model:
hailo optimize yolov7.har --calib-set-path sampledata.npy
We get
yolov7_optimized.har
1.6. Compile the model
hailo compiler yolov7_optimized.har
We get
yolov7.hef
which we will copy to the microSD of
JeVois-Pro
The compiler predicts 12.27 FPS for this model, which sounds pretty good given its size. Note that it aimed for a compute utilization of 75% and does indeed achieve that. Maybe that can be increased through some parameter. For faster FPS, yolov7-tiny is available, or one could reduce the input size.
1.7. Create JeVois-Pro YAML zoo file
We start with any of the YOLO entries in zoo file spu.yml already in the JeVois microSD (and available in the Config tab of the GUI).
For YOLO post-processing, we need definitions of anchors (prototypical box shapes that will be used to predict object boxes). We just get those from
https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/blob/main/cfg/deploy/yolov7.yaml
, towards top:
anchors:
- [12,16, 19,36, 40,28]
# P3/8
- [36,75, 76,55, 72,146]
# P4/16
- [142,110, 192,243, 459,401]
# P5/32
In the YAML file below, we will separate the 3 sets of anchors for the 3 YOLO scales by semicolons.
Because YOLOv7 uses the "new style" of YOLO coordinates, we need to disable Post-Processor sigmoid and set Post-Processor scalexy to 2.0. You would want that for YOLOv5/v7. Conversely, set sigmoid to true and scalexy to 0.0 (defaults) to use old-style box coordinates for YOLOv2/v3/v4. You can look at the differences in jevois::dnn::PostProcessorDetectYOLO::yolo_one()
Here, actually, it looks like these 3 Conv layers we used for our outputs have linear activation in that particular model (check them out in Netron). So we need to set sigmoid to true as the post-processor will require that for YOLO decoding.
We just modify the name and file locations, bring all the global definitions that were in spu.yml into our file (like preproc, nettype, etc which were set globally in spu.yml and hence not repeated for the entry we are copying from), and end up with the following
yolov7.yml
%YAML 1.0
---
yolov7:
preproc: Blob
mean:
"0 0 0"
scale: 0.0039215686
nettype: SPU
model:
"dnn/custom/yolov7.hef"
postproc: Detect
detecttype: RAWYOLO
anchors:
"12,16, 19,36, 40,28;   36,75, 76,55, 72,146;   142,110, 192,243, 459,401"
classes:
"dnn/labels/coco-labels.txt"
sigmoid: true
scalexy: 2.0
Note
We do not need to (and cannot) specify
intensors
and
outtensors
with Hailo models, the specs are embedded in the HEF file.
We copy yolov7.yml and yolov7.hef to /jevoispro/share/dnn/custom/ on JeVois-Pro and let's try it!
1.8. Test the model and adjust any parameters
Select the
DNN
machine vision module
Set the
pipe
parameter to
SPU:Detect:yolov7
It works! Indeed about 12.2 FPS for the network inference, as promised by the compiler. This is a large model and also using 640x640 inputs. If you need higher frame rate, try smaller inputs or yolov7-tiny. Or try YOLOv5m-640 provided by the Hailo team, it runs at over 45 FPS on JeVois-Pro.
Another example for Approach 1: YOLOv9s discrete head pose by PINTO0309
Clone the repo:
git clone
https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo.git
Select which model you want, here
cd PINTO_model_zoo/458_YOLOv9-Discrete-HeadPose-Yaw/
Download the models:
./download_s.sh
Get a calibration dataset, coco2017 as used above will work for this, or maybe a dataset with lots of heads in various poses.
Inspect he model in Netron and determine which outputs to use.
We will use the output nodes for yolov9s as specified in our tutorial
http://jevois.org/tutorials/UserYolo.html
Convert the model (say no to adding nms postprocess code, we will use faster JeVois post-processing):
hailo parser onnx yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024.onnx --end-node-names /model.22/cv2.0/cv2.0.2/Conv /model.22/cv3.0/cv3.0.2/Conv /model.22/cv2.1/cv2.1.2/Conv /model.22/cv3.1/cv3.1.2/Conv /model.22/cv2.2/cv2.2.2/Conv /model.22/cv3.2/cv3.2.2/Conv
hailo optimize yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024.har --calib-set-path sampledata.npy
hailo compiler yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024_optimized.har
Note
If you get an error
onnx.onnx_cpp2py_export.checker.ValidationError: Your model ir_version 10 is higher than the checker's (9).
that means that you need to use an older version of ONNX during the export in step 1. We recommend installing
pip install ultralytics
in the hailo container to avoid this problem, then copy the model's .pt file to the container and run the export to ONNX in the hailo container.
We get
yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024.hef
which is ready for JeVois-Pro.
Create a JeVois zoo YAML file
yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024-custom.yml
for this model as for the other above:
%YAML 1.0
---
yolov9s-headpose-1024x576-custom:
preproc: Blob
mean:
"0 0 0"
scale: 1.0
nettype: SPU
model:
"dnn/custom/yolov9_s_discrete_headpose_0100_1x3x576x1024.hef"
postproc: Detect
detecttype: YOLOv8t
classes:
"dnn/labels/discrete-headpose.txt"
Note
Label file
dnn/labels/discrete-headpose.txt
is already on the
JeVois-Pro
microSD, or create a new list of class names as needed.
For more examples, see our tutorial:
http://jevois.org/tutorials/UserYolo.html
Approach 2: Model conversion using the Hailo Model Zoo converter
For models which Hailo has already converted, we can use the Hailo Model Zoo for conversion, using instead our custom retrained model, or custom input sizes, etc. This will ensure best compatibility with existing JeVois post-processors.
A copy of the Hailo Model Zoo is already in the Hailo docker.
The steps will be:
Find config files for the same network as we want to convert, and modify them as needed.
Download any needed dataset for quantization using scripts provided in the Hailo Model Zoo.
Use
hailomz
to parse, optimize, and compile the model.
This will basically execute the same steps as outlined above, but using config files that have been optimized by the Hailo team for a specific model architecture, as opposed to us having to figure out which outputs we want in Netron, and other configuration/optimization parameters. For example, a set of outputs is defined in the config files, possible additional sigmoid activations applied to them, etc.
Here we convert yolo11m pre-trained to use input resolution 1024x576 (width x height) which has the correct aspect ratio for the JeVois-Pro camera sensor. At the time of this writing, yolo11 just came out, so it was not yet in the Hailo Model Zoo. By the time you read this, it may already be included in a later version of the Hailo model zoo.
Note
Starting with Yolo version 11, Ultralytics is now using name yolo11 as opposed to yolov11...
2.1. Download and export the model to ONNX
The Hailo toolchain may use slightly old software, while packages like Ultralytics will use the latest. This can create compatibility issues, For example, max supported ONNX ir_version (internal representation version) is 8 with the Hailo toolchain at the time of this writing, while just exporting a YOLO model from Ultralytics will use version 9.
Beyond the ir_version which relates to the internal structure of the ONNX file, ONNX also has various opset variants, which are the set of operators that are supported. Harware accelerators will not support the latest ONNX operators, since their silicon was designed a few years ago, but will support the basic convolution, sigmoid, etc operators that we need for the bulk of the network. So you may also want to export with an older opset, e.g., opset 12.
# To avoid compatibility issues with different versions of ONNX, you may want to run this inside the hailo container
# (or, you could try to run it on a machine that has an older ONNX installed; for example, `pip install onnx==1.12.0`):
pip install ultralytics
# If you have retrained your model, use your .pt file instead of yolo11m.pt below.
# Export to ONNX; see https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/onnx/ and https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/export/
yolo export model=yolo11m.pt format=onnx imgsz=576,1024 opset=12 optimize simplify
# Run it again if told to (on first export)
cp yolo11m.onnx /local/shared_with_docker/.hailomz/
Load it in Netron and check the ONNX version (click on the input node) and that the structure is correct.
2.2. Create a modified config file
Everything we run below is from inside the docker container we started above.
Yolo11 is very similar to YoloV8, so the Hailo config files for YoloV8 will almost work as-is. Critical for other models will be to inspect them in Netron and decide which output nodes you want to use.
For this network, we also want to disable Hailo post-processing which is much slower than the JeVois version.
cd hailo_model_zoo/hailo_model_zoo/cfg/networks/
cp yolov8m.yaml yolo11m.yaml
# Chnage location of source onnx file:
sed -i
's/models_files/yolo11m.onnx #/'
yolo11m.yaml
sed -i
's/url:/#url:/'
yolo11m.yaml
# Change the input size: we replace 640x640x3 by 576x1024x3 in the config file (may not be needed?):
sed -i
's/640x640x3/576x1024x3/'
yolo11m.yaml
# Change network name:
sed -i
's/network_name: yolov8m/network_name: yolo11m/'
yolo11m.yaml
# Disable Hailo post-processing, we will use faster JeVois code:
sed -i
's/nms_postprocess/#nms_postprocess/'
../alls/generic/yolov8m.alls
# Fix output shapes (may not be needed?; the value 80 below is number of classes):
sed -i
's/output_shape: 80x5x100/output_shape: 1x72x128x64, 1x72x128x80, 1x36x64x64, 1x36x64x80, 1x18x32x64, 1x18x32x80/'
yolo11m.yaml
# Change output tensor names (see Netron), from model.22 in yolov8m to model.23 in yolo11m:
sed -i

# We can also play with device utilization or compiler optimization parameters:
echo
'performance_param(compiler_optimization_level=max)'
>> ../alls/generic/yolov8m.alls
# or (but not both):
#echo 'resources_param(strategy=greedy, max_compute_utilization=0.9, max_control_utilization=0.95, max_memory_utilization=0.9)' >> ../alls/generic/yolov8m.alls
# Inspect the corresponding ../alls/generic/yolov8m.alls and it looks like we will not change anything.
# Also inspect the other config files that are included by yolo11m.yaml and its includes.
Note
Different YOLO network sizes (n,t,s,m,l,x) use different output node names. Always inspect in Netron. For a list of output nodes to use with various YOLO variants above v8, see our tutorial:

2.3. Convert the model for Hailo using hailomz
The next step is to run 'hailomz compile yolo11m'; however, we encountered a few hurdles, which we will address now:
First, we need to download a dataset for model calibration, here COCO2017 calib. See
https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo/blob/master/docs/DATA.rst
python hailo_model_zoo/hailo_model_zoo/datasets/create_coco_tfrecord.py calib2017
The downloaded dataset was not in the directory expected by the model zoo's config files, fix that:
cd /local/shared_with_docker/.hailomz/models_files/coco/
ln -s 2023-08-03 2021-06-18
cd /local/workspace
We are now ready to convert (could take several hours):
hailomz compile yolo11m
We get
yolo11m.hef
which is ready to run on JeVois-Pro. We will rename it when copying to microSD below.
2.4. Create JeVois-Pro YAML zoo file
We need to specify what kind of pre-processing to use, network type, and post-processing type. You can look at similar entries in spu.yaml for guidance. We end up with the following
yolo11m-custom.yml
%YAML 1.0
---
yolo11m-custom:
preproc: Blob
mean:
"0 0 0"
scale: 1.0
nettype: SPU
model:
"dnn/custom/yolov11m-custom.hef"
postproc: Detect
detecttype: YOLOv8
# Class label file, here COCO (create your own custom list of object labels for a custom model):
classes:
"dnn/labels/coco-labels.txt"
# Because Hailo .alls file added a sigmoid to class probabilities outputs, turn off sigmoid in JeVois postproc:
sigmoid: false
We copy
yolo11m-custom.yml
and
yolo11m-custom.hef
to /jevoispro/share/dnn/custom/ on JeVois-Pro and let's try it:
cp yolo11m.hef /media/${USER}/JEVOISPRO/share/dnn/custom/yolo11m-custom.hef
cp yolo11m-custom.yaml /media/${USER}/JEVOISPRO/share/dnn/custom/
2.5. Test the model and adjust any parameters
Select the
DNN
machine vision module
Set the
pipe
parameter to
SPU:Detect:yolo11m-custom
Tips
You may want to start with the models in the
Hailo Model Zoo
. Those should convert well, and also you can get an idea of their speed beforehand by looking at the GFLOPS figures. Note, however, that some detection models have been converted with quite unusual sets of outputs, which the JeVois PostProcessor may not support. All the model architectures in
JeVois-Pro Deep Neural Network Benchmarks
should work using the same sets of output tensors.
The Hailo Model Zoo Github has several dockers and instructions on how to retrain some of these models:
