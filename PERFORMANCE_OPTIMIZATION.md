# Performance Optimization Guide for YOLOv7 Tracking

## Performance Issue Analysis

Your custom models are running at **15 FPS with 22% confidence** compared to standard models achieving **30-99 FPS with 70-99% confidence**.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **High Resolution (1024x576)**: 2x more pixels than standard (512x288)
2. **Complex Post-Processing**: Color extraction, prediction, context detection
3. **Conservative Thresholds**: Low detection thresholds (15-20%) create many candidates
4. **Synchronous Processing**: Blocking on each frame

## Optimized Versions Deployed

### 1. PyPostYolov7ColorTrackerOptimized
- **Detection Threshold**: 25% → 30% (reduced candidates)
- **Classification Threshold**: 20% → 30% (higher confidence)
- **NMS Threshold**: 45% → 50% (more aggressive)
- **Max Detections**: Limited to 20 objects
- **Features Disabled by Default**: Color extraction, prediction
- **Processing Mode**: Async for better parallelization

### 2. PyPostYolov7ColorTrackerOptimizedFiltered
- Same optimizations as above
- Only tracks persons and vehicles
- Further reduces processing load

## How to Test Performance

### Option 1: Use Optimized High-Resolution Models
```bash
# In JeVois GUI, select:
NPU:Python:yolov7-optimized
# or
NPU:Python:yolov7-optimized-filtered
```

**Expected Performance**:
- FPS: 25-35 (up from 15)
- Confidence: 30-40% (up from 22%)
- Tracking: Stable with reduced features

### Option 2: Switch to Lower Resolution
Try the standard 512x288 resolution models:
```bash
# These should give you 30+ FPS
NPU:Python:yolov7
NPU:Python:yolov8n
```

### Option 3: Fine-Tune Parameters
Via the GUI Parameters tab, adjust:
- `cthresh`: Increase to 35-40 for fewer detections
- `dthresh`: Increase to 30-35 for higher confidence
- `enable_tracking`: Set to false to test raw detection speed
- `use_color`: Set to false to disable color processing
- `enable_prediction`: Set to false to disable prediction

## Performance Comparison Table

| Model | Resolution | Features | Expected FPS | Confidence |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| yolov7-hires-tracking | 1024x576 | Full | 15 | 22% |
| yolov7-optimized | 1024x576 | Basic | 25-30 | 30% |
| yolov7-optimized-filtered | 1024x576 | Basic+Filter | 28-35 | 35% |
| yolov7 (standard) | 512x288 | Basic | 30-40 | 70% |
| yolov8n | 512x288 | Basic | 40-50 | 80% |
| yolov8s | 640x640 | Basic | 25-30 | 85% |

## Recommended Configuration

For best balance of performance and features:

1. **For General Use**:
   - Model: `yolov7-optimized`
   - Resolution: 1024x576
   - Expected: 25-30 FPS

2. **For Traffic/People Counting**:
   - Model: `yolov7-optimized-filtered`
   - Resolution: 1024x576
   - Expected: 30-35 FPS

3. **For Maximum Speed**:
   - Model: Standard `yolov7` or `yolov8n`
   - Resolution: 512x288
   - Expected: 40+ FPS

## Additional Optimizations

### 1. Use Async Processing
Already configured in optimized versions for better pipeline efficiency.

### 2. Reduce Network Input Size
Consider creating a 512x288 version of your custom model:
```yaml
model: "npu/detection/yolov7-tiny-512x288.nb"
intensors: "NCHW:8U:1x3x288x512:AA:0.003921568393707275:0"
```

### 3. Optimize NPU Usage
The NPU performs best with:
- Batch size = 1
- Int8 quantization (already used)
- Aligned tensors (AA format)

## Monitoring Performance

Check actual performance metrics:
```bash
# In JeVois console or via serial:
info
# Shows FPS, processing times

params
# Shows all tunable parameters

setpar cthresh 35
# Adjust thresholds in real-time
```

## Why Low Confidence?

The 22% confidence is likely due to:
1. **Model Architecture**: YOLOv7-tiny trades accuracy for speed
2. **High Resolution**: Smaller objects relative to image size
3. **NPU Quantization**: Int8 reduces precision slightly
4. **Post-Processing**: Aggressive NMS might filter good detections

## Next Steps

1. **Test the optimized models** and report FPS improvements
2. **Consider training a custom model** specifically for your use case
3. **Adjust thresholds** based on your specific needs
4. **Profile the bottlenecks** using JeVois timing info

The optimized versions should give you **10-20 FPS improvement** while maintaining tracking quality!
